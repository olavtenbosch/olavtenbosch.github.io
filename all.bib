We argue that visual analytics of metadata of collections can be used in multiple ways: for the backend users, to inform the archive about structure and growth of its collection; to foster collection strategies; and to check metadata consistency, for the end-users, to give an overview to the collections, and thus to generate more awareness of the collection and its metadata, to give the enduser extra information to contextualize the entirety of the archive. We conclude with a discussion on how text based search combined with different type of visually enhanced browsing improves data access, navigation, and reuse in these two radically different contexts.},
